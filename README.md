# LSTM-In-Deep-Learning
Introduction
This repository provides an implementation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for various time series forecasting and sequence prediction tasks. LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that are effective in capturing long-term dependencies in sequences, making them ideal for tasks such as natural language processing, stock price prediction, weather forecasting, and more.

Features
Implementation of LSTM models using TensorFlow/Keras.
Preprocessing and preparation of sequential data.
Training and evaluating LSTM models for time series forecasting.
Hyperparameter tuning for optimizing model performance.
Visualization of model performance metrics like loss and accuracy.
Installation
To get started with this LSTM project, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lstm-project.git
cd lstm-project
Install the dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and TensorFlow or PyTorch installed. The requirements.txt file includes all the necessary libraries for the project.

Usage
You can use this repository to train an LSTM model on your own dataset. Follow the steps below:

Prepare your dataset in a CSV format with time-series data.
Modify the config.py or directly update the parameters in the training script.
Run the training script:
bash
Copy code
python train.py --data your_data.csv --epochs 100 --batch_size 32
For more details on the command-line arguments, use:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --help
Model Training
To train an LSTM model on your dataset, you can use the train.py script. This script allows you to configure parameters such as the number of epochs, learning rate, batch size, and more.

Example of training a model:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --data "path/to/your/data.csv" --epochs 50 --learning_rate 0.001
After training, the model weights will be saved in the models/ directory, and training logs will be available for visualization in logs/.

Examples
Check out the notebooks/ folder for Jupyter notebooks with detailed examples and explanations on:

Time series forecasting with LSTM.
Sequence classification using LSTM.
LSTM hyperparameter tuning.
You can run the notebooks using:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
